HideLoginScreenUI repository that contains files to replace elements with transparent ones in the _World of Warcraft_ login screen.

### How to add?

Just place the folders, `Fonts` and `Interface`, in the _World of Warcraft_ install folder (i.e. `World of Warcraft/_retail_`).

* `_retail_` = modern World of Warcraft (i.e. Shadowlands)
* `_ptr_` = World of Warcraft (Public Test Realm)
* `_classic_ptr_` = World of Warcraft: Burning Crusade Classic (Public Test Realm)
* `_classic_era_` = World of Warcraft: Classic
* `_classic_` = World of Warcraft: Burning Crusade Classic
* `_beta_` = World of Warcraft (beta)

### How to remove?

Just delete the folder `Fonts` and delete all the folders in `Interface`, except the `AddOns` folder.

### Why?

I use this to get clean screenshots of the login screen for use on the Wowpedia article, [Loading screen](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Loading_screen), which contains all the past and current looks with and without the interface. Others may just want to check it out.

### Known issues

* Currently _Shadowlands_ and _Burning Crusade Classic_ displays "square boxes" for the font. See [Issue.jpg](Issue.jpg).
