HideLoginScreenUI repository that contains files to replace elements with transparent ones in the _World of Warcraft_ login screen.

### How to add?

Just place the folders, `Fonts` and `Inteface`, in the _World of Warcraft_ install folder (i.e. `World of Warcraft/_retail_`).

### How to remove?

Just delete the folder `Fonts` and delete all the folders in `Interface`, except the `AddOns` folder.

### Known issues

* Currently _Shadowlands_ and _Burning Crusade Classic_ displays "square boxes" for the font. See [Issue.jpg](Issue.jpg).
